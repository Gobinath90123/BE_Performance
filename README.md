```

```bash
cd BE_Performance
```
**2. Install JMeter**  
Download and extract Apache JMeter 5.6.3 from the [official website](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

**3. Run a JMeter test script**  
Navigate to your JMX files directory (e.g., `BE_Integration Environment`), then execute:
```bash
jmeter -n -t "<path-to-your-jmx-file>" -l "<path-to-result-file>.jtl"
```

**4. Generate HTML report**  
After running your test, use:
```bash
jmeter -g "<path-to-result-file>.jtl" -o "<path-to-html-report-dir>"
```

**5. View the report**  
Open the generated HTML report folder in your browser.

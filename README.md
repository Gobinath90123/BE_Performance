BE_Performance - JMeter End-to-End Execution 

This repository contains JMeter test scripts for performance testing the Benchmark Estimating project. This guide explains how to run the JMeter tests end-to-end, including setup, execution, and report generation. 

 

üåø Branch 

This README refers to the develope branch. 

 

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites 

Before running the tests, ensure the following are installed: 

Java 17 (or a compatible version) 

Apache JMeter 5.6.3 (or the version used in the workflow) 

Git (to clone the repo and manage branches) 

Windows, Linux, or macOS (workflow tested on Windows) 

 

üöÄ Running JMeter Tests Locally 

1. Clone the Repository 

git clone https://github.com/Gobinath90123/BE_Performance.git 
cd BE_Performance 
git checkout develope 
 

2. Install JMeter 

Download and extract Apache JMeter 5.6.3 from the official website. 

3. Run the JMeter Test Scripts 

Navigate to the directory containing your JMX files (e.g., BE_Integration Environment), then execute: 

jmeter -n -t "<path-to-your-jmx-file>" -l "<path-to-result-file>.jtl" 
 

4. Generate HTML Reports 

After test execution, generate an HTML report from the .jtl file: 

jmeter -g "<path-to-result-file>.jtl" -o "<path-to-html-report-dir>" 
 

5. View Reports 

Open the generated HTML report folder in a browser to analyze the performance test results. 

 

‚ö° GitHub Actions: Automated JMeter Execution 

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow: 
 .github/workflows/run-jmeter-tests.yml 
 which automates running JMeter tests on every push or manual trigger on the develope branch. 

üîç Workflow Details 

Runs on windows-latest runner 

Installs Java 17 and JMeter 5.6.3 automatically 

Executes all .jmx files inside the JMX files directory 

Saves results and generates HTML reports 

Uploads reports as GitHub Action artifacts for download 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Triggering the Workflow Manually 

Go to the Actions tab on GitHub. 

Select the Run All JMeter Tests workflow. 

Click Run workflow and choose the develope branch. 

The workflow will execute and upload test reports as downloadable artifacts. 

 

üìå Notes 

Ensure .jmx files are in the correct directory as defined in the workflow. 

Customize the workflow or test scripts to fit your environment. 

Reports generated by GitHub Actions can be downloaded for deeper analysis.
